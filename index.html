            <span class="bio">My name is Hugo Moises Granados and I was born and raised in Anaheim California. I grew up
                with a loving father, mother, brother and sister. I've lived in an apartment complex at the center of
                Anaheim for most of my life. Both of my parents came from Guatemala and I'm the youngest sibling. Me and
                my siblings all went to the same schools starting with Benjamin Franklin Elementary School, then South
                Jr High, and finally Anaheim High School.<br><br> My life completely changed during the end of
                elementary school and the first year of middle school. The pandemic in 2020 completely changed the
                course of my life and forced me to adapt. I missed out on meeting people at a new school and had to
                learn how to deal with being isolated. As of now, Iâ€™m just a sophomore trying to get through the school
                year. My post high school goals include going to college to get a major in computer science, moving out,
                and getting a job.
